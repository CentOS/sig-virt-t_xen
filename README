just a simple test suite to ensure we can convert a CentOS-6/x86_64 machine instance into a Xen Dom0 and instantiate CentOS-5 and CentOS-6 VM's for 32bit and 64bit x86 in paravirt and hvm modes.

The base tests only run inside a VirtualMachine at http://ci.dev.centos.org/ and therefore the initial focus is on the paravirt images.
