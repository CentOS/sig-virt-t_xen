Just a simple test suite to ensure we can convert a CentOS-6/x86_64 machine instance into a Xen Dom0 and instantiate CentOS-5 and CentOS-6 VM's for 32bit and 64bit x86 in paravirt and hvm modes.

The base tests only run inside a VirtualMachine at http://ci.dev.centos.org/ and therefore the initial focus is on the paravirt images.

----
How this works:
- t_xen.sh script needs to be called as:
  ./t_xen.sh <ip|hostname>
  this script will login to the machine, setup a few basic things and rsync the 
  test suite content over to the remote machine, upgrade the machine to the latest
  updates released on mirror.centos.org and reboot the machine ( after setting up
  the install-xen.sh script to run post boot )
- the install-xen.sh script will install the centos-release-xen package, setup
  xen dom0 to boot next and reboot the machine ( after setting up the runtests.sh
  script to run post-bootup )
- runtests.sh is considered stage-3, and is where all the sanity testing as well as
  running instances of the various centos vm images takes place. Its split out into
  its own script to make it easier to run on its own ( eg. when we dont need the 
  environ prep done in the previous stages. ) 

----
The Test assertion / confidence:

The reason why we are doing this, nightly, is to build confidence around the CentOS
xen4centos repos, around the CentOS update packages and the mirror / repo sanity for
xen4centos. We are only running the stable released xen4centos code on the test suite.
